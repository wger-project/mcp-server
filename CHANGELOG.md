# Changelog

Changes to the wger REST API itself are documented in the backend's release
notes. This file records important changes to *this package*.

## Unreleased

* `add_exercise_with_sets` deletes the slot it created when the exercise cannot
  be attached to it. Such a slot holds no exercise, renders in no plan view and
  is listed by no routine tool, so a caller could not find it to clean it up. If
  the cleanup delete fails as well, the response still carries the slot id and
  reports `slot_rolled_back: false`.
* `log_set` can attach a set to the plan it was performed from, via the new
  `routine_id`, `slot_entry_id` and `iteration` arguments. Logs written without
  them are freestanding: wger reads a routine's log view and its statistics
  through that link, so an unattached set is invisible there and in the apps
  that show a plan's progress.
* New tool `get_workout_for_date`: what a routine prescribes on a given date,
  one entry per planned set, with the exercise name and the ids `log_set`
  needs. Reading the same thing by walking days, slots, entries and configs
  costs dozens of requests.
* First release on PyPI: `pip install wger-mcp` / `uvx wger-mcp` instead of needing a git checkout.
